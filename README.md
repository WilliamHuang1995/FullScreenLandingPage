super easy tutorial that most websites use.  
The key is to use VH. Also make sure you remove any padding and margin that are automatically generated based on some html tags (e.g. H1 has margin top set to something nonzero)  
The bottom utilizes flexbox. A good way to learn how to use flexbox is to play flexbox froggy. But personally I am more inclined to still use the grid system.
